Buildoing UI with Components

-UI can be broken down into smaller building blocks called components.
-It allow you to build self-contained, reusable snippets of code.

If you think of components as LEGO bricks, 
you can take these individual bricks and combine them together 
to form larger structures. If you need to update a piece of the UI, 
you can update the specific component or brick.


-Props
you can pass pieces of information 
as properties to React components. These are called props.
